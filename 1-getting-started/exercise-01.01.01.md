# Exercise 1.1.1

> Give an expression and a declaration.
> Explain the structure of a declaration.
> Explain nesting of expressions.
> Give a type.

---

An example of a declaration:
```ocaml
let x = 5
```
An example of an expression:
```ocaml
3 + 5
```

A declaration is of the form
```ocaml
let ⟨identifier⟩ = ⟨expression⟩
```

We are not sure what there is to explain about nesting of expressions.

Examples for types are `int` and `bool`.
