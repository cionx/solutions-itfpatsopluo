# Exercise 2.5.2

> Extend the grammar for abstract expressions with rules for declarations and programs and design corresponding typing rules.
> Hint:
> Use judgments $E \vdash D \Rightarrow E'$ and $E \vdash P \Rightarrow E'$ and model programs with the grammar rule $P \Coloneqq \emptyset \mid D P$ ($\emptyset$ is the empty program).
