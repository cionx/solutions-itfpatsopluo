# Exercise 2.3.3

> Give two inference rules for judgments `x < y` such that a judgment `x < y` is derivable if and only if `x + k * 5 = y` for some `k >= 1`.

---

(We once again use `<` for `<`.)

We can use the following two inference rules:
```text
                     x < y
---------          ---------
x < x + 5          x < y + 5
```
